Are Lactobacillus mulieris and Lactobacillus jensenii present in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract?

Introduction:
Both L.mulleris and L.jensenii are dominant members of the female urogenital microbiome. L.mulleris is a recently recognized species, however, they share identical 16S rRNA sequences. This project aims to assess whether these species are also present in the gastrointestinal tract. The interest of these species in the GI tract is important as L.jensenii helps the body digest food and absorb nutrients.
